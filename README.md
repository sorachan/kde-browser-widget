# KDE Web Browser Widget

The original KDE web browser widget automatically scales views narrower than 1000px to a virtual width of 1000px which isn't a bad idea in itself, but can be a huge pain in the arse when trying to work with several browser views on one desktop. This version has been modified to include configurable static and dynamic zoom.

Now I'll just need to figure out how to get this to the KDE folks, I'd love to contribute my work :)
